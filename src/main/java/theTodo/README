This is an example character template for the more experienced Slay the Spire modder.
It contains the basics of an empty character, as well as:
- Improved X cost action framework (Alchyr)
- General action use wizard for any effects (GK + my own stuff)
- Lambda power support (mine)
- Automatic ability to apply TempPowers. Make any power a Flex! (me)
- AbstractRelic, Power and Card with improved image loading and other shortcuts (alchyr + mine)
- AbstractCard comes with secondary variable and secondary damage (me + Kio)
- IntelliJ template to easily make lots of cards (me + GK)
- Hopefully more! Let me know if there's something you'd want added!!

Setup guide:
-Change MODID in TodoMod.
-Change details in pom.xml to match your mod locations.
-Probably more, lemme test this
